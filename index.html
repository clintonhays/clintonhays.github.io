            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Nothing is more important to me than learning and <span>the pursuit of knowledge</span>. I've found that as I've gotten older, my desire to learn has just gotten stronger. About a year ago, I decdided to let my thirst for knowledge take me where it would. It lead me to the <span>world of coding</span>. I can't think of a better path for someone who is driven by learning because, as I'm discovering, there is <span>always</span> something new just around the corner.</p>
            <p>I've devoted myself to this trade and I plan to learn as much as humanly possible about it.</p>

                        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                        <p>Bootstrap was a new framework for me, I had trouble getting my head around the grid system in the beginning. Bootstrap is also very limiting, so adjusting small details or style choices is almost impossible.</p>
                        <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                        <p>I feel like Bootstrap is a tool that I could make use of in very specific situations. For projects that don't require lots of intricate customization, it could save a lot of time. But, personally...I still enjoy writing my own Sass.</p>

                        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                        <p>HTML forms are very robust, requiring attributes and labels. It was a challenge to make sure that everything was connected correctly. Additionally, inputs are not as easy to style as other elements. It took a lot of research to find out what parts of inputs can be styled. I attempted to use neumorphism approach to the style. It was challenging and rewarding, but I'm sure that I can refactor the design to be even more dynamic. I plan to add validation to this form using Javascript.</p>
                        <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                        <p>Forms are something that I want to learn more about. I want to make sure that in the future my forms are accessible and use correct markup. In addition, when styling forms, I realized that user experience needs to be at the forefront of consideration. It was a great learning experience and overall quite a fun project.</p>

                        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                        <p>This was my first attempt at using an API. Thankfully, using promises made it a lot easier. My biggest speedbump came when trying to wrap my head aorund pulling information from the API. Once I started thinkning in terms of objects, it made much more sense. I also ran into a little trouble when creating the search function because I didn't fully understand the difference between static and live html lists. Now that I have a better understanding of these lists, I'll hopefully run into fewer issues in the future.</p>
                        <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                        <p>Almost immediately after working on this project, I started to think of other projects that I could use an API for. I've got a few fun things I'd like to do just get some more practice in. There is something very interesting to me about pulling data out of collections of objects. I am very interested in the practices of consolodating, effeciency, and using the right tool for the job. I think APIs offer a great way hit those key areas.</p>
