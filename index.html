            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Nothing is more important to me than learning and <span>the pursuit of knowledge</span>. I've found that as I've gotten older, my desire to learn has only grown stronger. About a year ago, I decided to let my thirst for knowledge take me where it would. It lead me to the <span>world of coding</span>. I can't think of a better path for someone who is driven by learning because, as I'm discovering, there is <span>always</span> something new just around the corner. Please have a look at my resume <a href="pdf/Clinton-Hays-Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Or download it <a href="pdf/Clinton-Hays-Resume.pdf" download="Clinton-Resume">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I've devoted myself to this trade and I plan to learn as much as humanly possible about it.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>Bootstrap was a new framework for me, I had trouble getting my head around the grid system in the beginning. Bootstrap is also very limiting, so adjusting small details or style choices is almost impossible.</p>

                            <p>I feel like Bootstrap is a tool that I could make use of in very specific situations. For projects that don't require lots of intricate customization, it could save a lot of time. But, personally...I still enjoy writing my own Sass.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>HTML forms are very robust, requiring many attributes and labels. It was important to make sure that everything was connected correctly. Additionally, inputs are not as easy to style as other elements. It took a lot of research to find out what parts of inputs can be styled. I attempted to use a neumorphism approach to the style. It was challenging and rewarding, but I'm sure that I can refactor the design to be even more dynamic. I plan to add validation to this form using Javascript.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>Forms are something that I want to learn more about. I want to make sure that in the future my forms are accessible and use correct markup. In addition, when styling forms, I realized that user experience needs to be at the forefront of consideration. It was a great learning experience and overall quite a fun project.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>This was my first attempt at using an API. Thankfully, using promises made it a lot easier. My biggest speedbump came when trying to wrap my head aorund pulling information from the API. Once I started thinkning in terms of objects, it made much more sense. I also ran into a little trouble when creating the search function because I didn't fully understand the difference between static and live html lists. Now that I have a better understanding of these lists, I'll hopefully run into fewer issues in the future.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>Almost immediately after working on this project, I started to think of other projects that I could use an API for. I've got a few fun things I'd like to do just get some more practice in. There is something very interesting to me about pulling data out of collections of objects. I am very interested in the practices of consolodating, effeciency, and using the right tool for the job. I think APIs offer a great way hit those key areas.</p>

                            <p>Create an interactive photo gallery that allows search and uses lightbox to interact with photos.</p>
                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>There were two main challnges with this project. The first was understanding how properly uss libraries, plugins, and modules. I had some initial trouble getting the baguettebox plug in working becuase I wasn't sure how the plugin interacted with my own code so the project file structure needed some adjusting on my end. After learning that a plugin really is just that...it all made sense. The second challenge was creating the search function from scratch. It took some research, but I eventually found a tutorial that really made sense. This was one of the first in depth Javascript projects I attemtped. After learning more about DOM traversal, search functions are much easier to understand and implement.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>This project showed me that plugins and libraries are powerfula nd useful tools. Since completing this project, I haven't implemented nearly enough of them into my other projects. Since I'm still learning, I like to use as much vanilla JS as possible, but I am ready to start expanding into the world of libraries and plugins.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>This was handsdown the most JavaScrip heavy project I tackled in the beginning of my coding journey. My main hurdles included gettign a grasp on how objects interact with one another. Trying to keep the relationships of the objects straight lead to some very frustrating moments. I also had a couple of issues with the file structure. Up to this point I had been working with a single JS file that I could peruse with ease when needed. This project really expanded the project file tree. But, I was eventually abel to wrap my head around both of these aspects.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>Object oriented JavaScript is a really diverse and powerful tool. There is a lot of structure that belies just how flexible the ability to code this was really is. While it can seem at times like a spiderweb of interacting objects, there is obviously, and necessarily, an order to the seemign chaos. Personally, I really like working with objects and arrays, so I find this kind of programming particularly rewarding. This project really solidified that for me. </p>
