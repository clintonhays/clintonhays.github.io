            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>Nothing is more important to me than learning and <span>the pursuit of knowledge</span>. I've found that as I've gotten older, my desire to learn has only grown stronger. About a year ago, I decided to let my thirst for knowledge take me where it would. It lead me to the <span>world of coding</span>. I can't think of a better path for someone who is driven by learning because, as I'm discovering, there is <span>always</span> something new just around the corner. Please have a look at my resume <a href="pdf/Clinton-Hays-Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Or download it <a href="pdf/Clinton-Hays-Resume.pdf" download="Clinton-Resume">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I've devoted myself to this trade and I plan to learn as much as humanly possible about it.</p>

                            <p>Bootstrap was a new framework for me, I had trouble getting my head around the grid system in the beginning. Bootstrap is also very limiting, so adjusting small details or style choices felt almost impossible.</p>

                            <p>I feel like Bootstrap is a tool that I could make use of in very specific situations. For projects that don't require lots of intricate customization, it could save a lot of time. But, personally...I still enjoy writing my own Sass.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>HTML forms are very robust, requiring many attributes and labels. It was important to make sure that everything was connected correctly. Additionally, inputs are not as easy to style as other elements. It took a lot of research to find out what parts of inputs can be styled. I attempted to use a neumorphism approach to the style. It was challenging and rewarding, but I'm sure that I can refactor the design to be even more dynamic. I plan to add validation to this form using Javascript.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>Forms are something that I want to learn more about. I want to make sure that in the future my forms are accessible and use correct markup. In addition, when styling forms, I realized that user experience and accessibility need to be at the forefront of consideration. It was a great learning experience and overall quite a fun project.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>This was my first attempt at using an API. Thankfully, using promises made it a lot easier. My biggest speedbump came when trying to wrap my head around pulling information from the API. Once I started thinkning in terms of objects, it made much more sense. I also ran into a little trouble when creating the search function because I didn't fully understand the difference between static and live html lists. Now that I have a better understanding of these lists, I'll hopefully run into fewer issues in the future.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>Almost immediately after working on this project, I started to think of other projects that I could use APIs for. I've got a few fun things I'd like to do just get some more practice in. There is something very interesting to me about pulling data out of collections of objects. I am very interested in the practices of consolodating, efficiency, and using the right tool for the job. I think APIs offer a great way hit those key areas.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>There were two main challenges with this project. The first was understanding how to properly use libraries, plugins, and modules. I had some initial trouble getting the baguettebox plugin working becuase I wasn't sure how the plugin interacted with my own code, so the project file structure needed some adjusting on my end. After learning that a plugin really is just that...it all made sense. The second challenge was creating the search function from scratch. It took some research, but I eventually found a tutorial that really made sense. This was one of the first in-depth Javascript projects I attemtped. After learning more about DOM traversal, search functions are much easier to understand and implement.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>This project showed me that plugins and libraries are powerful and useful tools. Since completing this project, I haven't implemented nearly enough of them into my other projects. Since I'm still learning, I like to use as much vanilla JS as possible, but I am ready to start expanding into the world of libraries and plugins.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>This was hands down the most JavaScript heavy project I tackled in the beginning of my coding journey. My main hurdles included getting a grasp on how objects interact with one another. Trying to keep the relationships of the objects straight lead to some very frustrating moments. I also had a couple of issues with the file structure. Up to this point I had been working with a single JS file that I could peruse with ease when needed. This project really expanded the project file tree. But, I was eventually able to wrap my head around both of these aspects.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>Object oriented JavaScript is a really diverse and powerful tool. There is a lot of structure that belies just how flexible the ability to code this was really is. While it can seem at times like a spiderweb of interacting objects, there is obviously, and necessarily, an order to the seeming chaos. Personally, I really like working with objects and arrays, so I find this kind of programming particularly rewarding. This project really solidified that for me. </p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>React really is a beast of a framework. The myriad challenges posed by React as a new developer was a bit overwhelming at first. I went through this particular tutorial twice and will probably go through one more time just to make sure I have all the concepts down. The main challenge for me is understanding how to structure an app from the beginning. I need more practice in looking at an app or mockup and breaking it down mentally into individual components. I know this will come with more practice, but as of right now, it’s still quite the challenge. The syntax and component interaction is still a bit muddled for me, but it’s becoming clearer each time I work with React. Another minor issue I ran into was making sure my file structure was correct, especially since I wanted to deploy through Github pages. Fortunately, there is plenty of documentation out there with how to deploy on Github pages.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>React will absolutely be my go to for frontend development. Although it’s a bit hard to understand at the moment, the theory behind it makes a lot of sense to me. I’ve always tried to break things down to their base elements in most things I’ve built. I like that React is built around exactly that. With smaller components in an app, it is easier to manipulate and improve over time. I need more practice with this framework, but I find it really fun to work with.</p>

                            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
                            <p>It had been a bit since I used an API and I had never integrated one into a React app before. So, my main challenge was understanding that in a React app the API could be used to update state. This made it much easier to implement the API data into the app. Second, I was a little unsure how CSS transitions worked with React. Looking back now, I realize that this shouldn’t have been a challenge at all, but while making the app, it didn’t occur to me that I could just target the property being set in the app through my SASS file directly. This is definitely one of those learning moments that will make things a lot easier moving forward.</p>
                            <h2>Takeaways:</h2>
                            <p>This project brought together two of my favorite things about web development...React and APIs. I had a lot of fun building this project and it has really inspired me to move forward with making an API database so I can create a fullstack app of my own.</p>
